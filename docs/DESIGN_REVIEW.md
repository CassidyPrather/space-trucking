# Design Review Checklist

[DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) asks for "some sort of system for intermittent
design review checklists to make sure we're not getting distracted from our
core goals". This is that system. Run the checklist at the end of every work
stage and before any merge to `main`, and paste the checked list into the PR
or commit description — a checklist nobody sees is a checklist nobody ran.
If a box cannot be checked honestly, that is the finding; fix it or defer it
deliberately below.

## The Checklist

- [ ] Whimsy first: did this change add or remove delight? Name one whimsical
      detail it touched.
- [ ] Zero text: no rendered strings besides the version corner; every new
      state communicates via shape/color/motion/sound.
- [ ] No currency: nothing countable functions as money — no credits, scores,
      or ratings.
- [ ] No progression creep: no upgrades, unlocks, or permanent power
      increases.
- [ ] Determinism proven: bit-identical, save-round-trip, and
      catch-up-equivalence tests cover every new mechanic and pass.
- [ ] Cargo is conserved: nothing the player owns vanishes or changes hands
      except through the accept lever, and the drag-monkey test covers any
      new interactive surface automatically.
- [ ] Affordances derive from the rules: anything drawn as a drop target or
      invitation comes from `Sim::drop_targets()`, `placement_check`, or the
      shared `layout` rects — never from re-derived geometry or a restated
      ownership rule.
- [ ] Pause, fast-forward, and save/load all still reachable and exercised
      this session.
- [ ] `src/sim/` and `src/synth.rs` import no macroquad; cues say what
      happened, never what it sounds like.
- [ ] Ambient soundscape only — no melodies; new loops pass the seam test.
- [ ] wasm within budget: ≤ 1.5 MB (paste the current byte count).
- [ ] Every asset, including vendored JS, has a CREDITS.md row; CC0/MIT
      preferred.
- [ ] Cargo tells the story: any new kind has a lore reason and a distinct
      silhouette.
- [ ] Deferred-deliberately list is current.

## Deferred deliberately

Out of scope on purpose, not forgotten. Revisit when the core loop stops
changing; remove a line only by shipping it or striking it in review.

- Orbital POI motion
- Mid-flight retargeting
- Major modules / multiplayer / crewing
- Central-server global objectives
- Telemetry + consent flow
- 3D/VRChat port
- Additional star systems
- More events (rats, mimics, ad bots, hull breaches)
